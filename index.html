        <b>A computer virus is a type of computer program that, when executed, replicates itself by modifying other computer programs and inserting its own code.<br> If this replication succeeds, the affected areas are then said to be "infected" with a computer virus, a metaphor derived from biological viruses.<br>Computer viruses generally require a host program.<br>The virus writes its own code into the host program. When the program runs, the written virus program is executed first, causing infection and damage. A computer worm does not need a host program, as it is an independent program or code chunk. Therefore, it is not restricted by the host program, but can run independently and actively carry out attacks.</b>
